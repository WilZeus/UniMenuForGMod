Henlo!

I'm guessing you came from Zoltin's discord server from this specific channel: "#work-or-pac3".
If not, then welcome to my little project! This is basically what I call a "Made out of Boredomness". This is still very barebones, as there are very lacking features.
And for your information, you do need to have sv_allowcslua enabled to load this lua. (I DONT CONDONE SV_ALLOWCSLUA BYPASSERS).
To install this, find your Garry's Mod folder, then go to "garrysmod\lua" and put this here. (if you don't put it here, you will be directed to this README.)
The features inside are:
- Toggle Build & PVP Mode (for said servers that have this)
- Player List
- RTV
- Suicide bind (for whatever reason requested by someone)
- The rules for Zoltin's sandbox
- Toggle goto for Zoltin's Sandbox
- Credits (hihihihih :))
- Tutorial (very cool)
That's all of them. If you want to contribute, or fork this, go right for it. I won't stop you.


If you want any feature's added, make a pull request and i'll add it in a later update.
